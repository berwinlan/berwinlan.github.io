        "description": "My partner and I modeled a passive solar house and focused on answering our modeling question, “what aspect of a solar house is financially worth upgrading in order to maximize its efficiency?” by observing the effects of sweeping certain parameters. We represented our model as a stock and flow diagram, schematic, first-order ordinary differential equations, and MATLAB computational simulation, bringing in data and outside sources to verify, validate, and assess the accuracy of our model.
